Lazaretto
=========

Is a licenseplate reader to read standardized Dutch plates.

A lazaretto or lazaret is a quarantine station which in this case runs individual parts needed to retrieve the needed information of the plates.

This is ment as a very basic setup to not confuse people. 

Id had planned to write TDD cases, but coworkers where unfamiliar with the concept and it only infuriated them.

Currently at 0.6.3
It has a GUI version and a commandline version.

So as they say in canada. Peace oot!
